# C++ Lane Detection Using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)

## Overview
This project implements a lane detection system using OpenCV in C++. The system processes both images and videos to detect lane markings on the road. It includes functionality for perspective mapping, image processing, and lane marking detection.

## Features
- **Image and Video Processing:** Detect lanes in both images and videos.
- **Perspective Mapping:** Transform the road view to a bird's-eye view.
- **Lane Detection:** Identify the left and right lane markings.
- **Data Based Calculations:** Calculate the relative distance to the lane center and relative lane deviation.
- **User Interface:** Basic console interface for changing settings.
